        <p>* Available for Qualified Purchasers only. Qualified Purchasers receive an Apple Gift Card when they purchase
            an Eligible Product at a Qualifying Location through September 30, 2024. Gift card values may vary by
            Eligible Product. Only one Apple Gift Card per Eligible Product per Qualified Purchaser. Offer subject to
            availability. While supplies last. Qualified Purchasers shall receive a discount equal to the value of the
            Apple Gift Card off the price of the Eligible Product, but will be charged for all items in their cart,
            including the Apple Gift Card. Important notice regarding the checkout receipt and monthly statement for
            Apple Card Monthly Installments (ACMI) purchases with this promotion: Qualified Purchasers selecting ACMI (a
            0% APR payment option available only in the U.S.) as payment type at checkout shall receive a discount equal
            to the value of the Apple Gift Card off the price of the Eligible Product. This will result in one ACMI
            installment plan over 12 months for the Eligible Product discounted by the instant credit, and a second ACMI
            installment plan over 12 months for the full price of the Apple Gift Card. The total combined amount charged
            over the two separate ACMI installment plans will reflect the original full retail price of the Eligible
            Product. Separately, Qualified Purchasers will receive and be charged for the Apple Gift Card in the amount
            of the applicable discount off the Eligible Product. Apple Card Monthly Installments (ACMI) is a 0% APR
            payment option that is only available if you select it at checkout in the U.S. for eligible products
            purchased at Apple Store locations, apple.com, the Apple Store app, or by calling 1-800-MY-APPLE, and is
            subject to credit approval and credit limit. See support.apple.com/kb/HT211204 for more information about
            eligible products. APR ranges may vary based on when you accepted an Apple Card. Cardholders who accept an
            Apple Card on and or after February 1, 2024: Variable APRs for Apple Card, other than ACMI, range from
            19.24% to 29.49% based on creditworthiness. Rates as of February 1, 2024. Existing cardholders: See your
            Customer Agreement for applicable rates and fee. If you buy an ACMI-eligible product by choosing to pay in
            full with Apple Card (instead of using ACMI), that purchase is subject to the Apple Card variable APR, not
            0% APR. Taxes and shipping on ACMI purchases are subject to the variable APR, not 0% APR. When you buy an
            iPhone with ACMI, youâ€™ll need to select AT&T, T-Mobile, or Verizon as your carrier when you check out. An
            iPhone purchased with ACMI is always unlocked, so you can switch carriers at any time. ACMI is not available
            for purchases made online at the following special stores: Apple Employee Purchase Plan; participating
            corporate Employee Purchase Programs; Apple at Work for small businesses; Government and Veterans and
            Military Purchase Programs; or on refurbished devices. The last monthâ€™s payment for each product will be the
            productâ€™s purchase price, less all other payments at the monthly payment amount. ACMI financing is subject
            to change at any time for any reason, including but not limited to installment term lengths and eligible
            products. See support.apple.com/kb/HT211204 for information about upcoming changes to ACMI financing. See

        <p>Clean and Minimalist Design: Apple is known for its clean and minimalist design ethos. Your store should
            reflect this with a clutter-free layout, ample white space, and intuitive navigation.

            Visual Appeal: Use high-quality images and videos to showcase products. Apple places a strong emphasis on
            visual appeal, so ensure your visuals are compelling and reflect the premium quality of Apple products.

            Responsive Design: Given the diversity of devices visitors might use (from iPhones to MacBooks), ensure your
            store is fully responsive. It should provide an optimal viewing experience across all screen sizes and
            devices.

            Focus on Product Details: Provide detailed descriptions, specifications, and features of each product. Apple
            customers often look for comprehensive information before making a purchase decision.

            User Experience (UX): Prioritize a seamless user experience. This includes easy navigation, quick load
